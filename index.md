The dhomer package provides easy access to South Carolina data that may impact social determinants of health.

This package contains several datasets provided by the EPA, HRSA, and other sites (to be specified).  The data is preprocessed into a common format to support spatial analysis.

The data sets are:

* one entry per data set, brief description of what the data represents and what data (columns) are available
* US EPA South Carolina Brownfield Sites (brownfields_processed.csv)- Brownfield sites are previously developed sites whose contaminants prevent redevelopment. The data includes the site names, addresses, latitudes/longitudes, GEOIDs, and census tract centroids.
* South Carolina Free Clinics (freeclincics_processed.csv)- Free clinics provide medical care to the impoverished and uninsured residents of South Carolina. The data includes the clinic names, addresses, latitudes/longitudes, GEOIDs, and census tract centroids.
