The dhomer package provides easy access to South Carolina data that may impact social determinants of health.

This package contains several datasets provided by the EPA, HRSA, and other sites (to be specified).  The data is preprocessed into a common format to support spatial analysis.

The data sets are:

* US EPA South Carolina Brownfield Sites (brownfields_processed.csv)- Brownfield sites are previously developed sites whose contaminants prevent redevelopment. The data includes the site names, addresses, latitudes/longitudes, GEOIDs, and census tract centroids.
* South Carolina Free Clinics (freeclincics_processed.csv)- Free clinics provide medical care to the impoverished and uninsured residents of South Carolina. The data includes the clinic names, addresses, latitudes/longitudes, GEOIDs, and census tract centroids.
* South Carolina Pharmacies (pharmacies_processed.csv)- A list of the pharmacies in South Carolina. The data includes the pharmacy names, locations, National Provider Identifer (NPI), details on the pharmacy services and pharmacists, contact information, latitudes/longitudes, GEOIDs, and census tract centroids.
* US EPA Contaminants of Concern (contaminants_processed.csv)- The US EPA compiled a list of uniquely difficult contaminants to clean in the environment. The list includes the site where the contaminant is found, the location, the contaminant found, details about cleanup efforts, latitudes/longitudes, GEOIDs, and census tract centroids.
* South Carolina Farmer's and Roadside Markets (markets_processed.csv)- SCDHEC compiled a list of farmer's and roadside markets in South Carolina which provide fresh produce to their communities. The data includes the market name, location, months of operation, contact information, latitudes/longitudes, GEOIDs, and census tract centroids.
* US EPA South Carolina Superfund Sites (superfund_contaminants.csv)- Superfund sites are contaminated sites identified by the US EPA and has allocated funds towards cleaning. The data includes the site names, locations, latitudes/longitudes, GEOIDs, and census tract centroids.
* South Carolina Health Facilities (health_facilities.csv)- SC DHEC compiled a list of licensed health facilities according to their records. The data includes a variety of health services, including their categorization, facility names, facility locations, contact information, latitudes/longitudes, GEOIDs, and census tract centroids.
